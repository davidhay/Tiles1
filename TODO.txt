Testing.
It should still work without tiles-support directive. It should then just use text.
I could put a watch in manually - and then update the class name [[This would be a good lesson on doing watching via code]]
if I use custom events to represent the moves. I can broadcast the move_R_C(left|right|up|down)
	if clicked on, we ask all neigbours to move.
		for(each neighbour in U,D,L,R)
			from gridController. broadcast(moveRequest,this tile);
	on(moveRequest,other Tile)
		if(this is the hole)
			return yes
		else
			if other tile is left and tile to right 				
					broadcast(moveRequest, this tile) 
			if other tile is right and tile to left
					broadbast(moveRequest, tile
